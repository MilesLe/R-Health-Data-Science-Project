## Introduction
The data sets used in this project are from Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports database (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/). This source includes data sets with identical variables about the mobility of populations from many countries and sub regions. The data is collected by Google for public health utility via their products such as Google Maps. In brevity, the data describes how the mobility of a diverse range of communities has changed in specific activities throughout the global Covid-19 pandemic (2020-2021). I obtained this data after doing research into databases and data sets related to the Covid-19 pandemic in my own local community. 
From this data, I hope to get a better understanding and obtain insight about how my local community, Alameda County, CA USA, has altered due to new public regulations and awareness of the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, I am interested in the differences of mobility between South Korea and the US. Hopefully, I will be able to better visualize how South Korea maintains a much stronger public health response than the US. 

I have two primary questions:

1. How does the US and South Korea compare in community mobility this past year? 

2. How does my local community, Alameda County, CA US, compare to the rest of California is community mobility this past year?



## Conclusions:

* In conclusion, the two graphs below summarize the general differences when comparing the United States and South Korea and comparing Alameda county, CA, and California. For the majority of months, the United States had a much more negative change in mobility of its population. This can be attributed to the longer term stay-at-home orders from the United States government compared to the Korean government. Furthermore, the mobility of the Korean population started the year with a large negative value, similar to the United States. However, unlike the United States, the mobility of the Korean population slowing began to increase as the year progressed. In terms of the mobility of the populations in California and Alameda county, both populations showed very similar activity, as demonstrated by the graph below. Furthermore, across the vast majority of months, California and Alameda county experienced a large decrease in average mobility of people. This makes sense since the pandemic has forced people in California to stay at home and avoid public activities. 

* For anyone choosing to work on this data set and script, it is important to keep in mind that my program only takes into account a small portion of the entire data. Furthermore, my program doesn't do any statistical analysis when it summarizes data or compares data in a table or graphically.
